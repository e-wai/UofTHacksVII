*Have trouble finding sustainable fashion? everwear suggests complementary and similar items from ethics-focused companies.* <br><br>We wanted to build a product for social good that was focused on fashion. After initially discussing outfit picking mechanisms and finding interest in using to computer vision to recognize clothing items, we decided to develop a website that would focus on finding ethically-sourced alternatives for clothing. Using our project, consumers can quickly find pieces they're interested in from a variety of sustainable fashion companies based on their preferences, which will hopefully make sustainable fashion more accessible.

## About our project
Users customize the website through our chatbot, which prompts them to upload images and answer questions about their preferences. Based on these preferences, the website will suggest a series of clothing items from sustainable fashion companies that might interest user, and links to buy them. <br><br>Our final product was built as a react website/app (along with it, we used Javascript, HTML, and CSS). The initial page's chatbot uses conversational-flow to facilitate prompts and responses. The backend uses Google Cloud custom search functions in order to find clothing items that are of interest to the user.<br><br>For more information, see https://devpost.com/software/everwear.
